//I want to move a plane to the top of the center of the screen

let scnView = self.view as SCNView
let camera = scnView.scene?.rootNode.childNodeWithName("camera", recursively: true)

let zPlanePosition: Float = ( camera!.camera!.zNear ) / camera!.camera!.zFar
let positionVector = scnView.unprojectPoint(SCNVector3(x: Float(scnView.bounds.width) / 2, y: 0, z: zPlanePosition))
plane.position = SCNVector3( x: positionVector.x, y: positionVector.y, z: camera!.position.z - positionVector.z - 1 )

//the z is slightly off, the x is exactly correc, but the y is completely off from what I expect
